        <h2>Who are you anyway?</h2>
        <p class="justify">My name is Sebastian Alvarez, im a Bachelor in computer science from the University of Costa Rica. I love developing programs, web pages and games, it's my biggest hobby. I consider myself to be a creative person and developing is my form of art. I like to challenge myself constantly. Working under pressure is no problem for me, 'cause I approach problems in an organized fassion. </p>

        <h2>The bits and bolts</h2>

        <p class="justify">For most, if not all, the functionality javascript was used. The main problem which was evaluating tournaments is solved using a recursive function that evaluates sub-tournaments until a single match is found. After that, it connects to the Parse database to update the scores of the players. It is all serverd from a AWS EC2 free server that lets you host a small website.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="section last-section">
        <h2>Why so technological?</h2>
          <p class="justify">Javascript and frameworks: Most of the solution was coded in plain js to keep things simple. The Parse Javascript SDK was used to connect to the database, because of its power and simplicity.</p>

          <p class="justify">Design: the tecnologies used here were CSS3 and HTML mostly, because what we needed was a website. Other tools were used in the design process like: GIMP 2 (asset creation), Codepen (test the website on the fly), Sumblime Text 2(editor)</p>

          <p class="justify">Last but not least I used Amazon EC2 server because they are free for a whole year and easy to set up (I had done it before). To host the code I used GitHub as sugested and because of the hype thats building around it.</p>
